# fourier-pixel-trace
A very math-heavy Java program with Processing library which takes an input image file containing a pixel path and computes a Fourier series that traces the path in the complex plane.

Idea behind this program came from a 3Blue1Brown video on [Fourier image visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k).
